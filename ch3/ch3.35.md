<!-- Unit Testing - In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. Intuitively, one can view a unit as the smallest testable part of an application.

> 单元测试 - 在计算机编程中，单元测试是一种软件测试的方法，它是源代码的独立单元，一个或多个计算机程序模块集合，以及关联的控制数据，使用程序和操作程序，以确定他们是否适合可用。直观地，可以将单元视为程序中最小的可测试部分。
<!-- 
Functional Testing - Functional testing is a quality assurance (QA) process and a type of black box testing that bases its test cases on the specifications of the software component under test. Functions are tested by feeding them input and examining the output, and internal program structure is rarely considered (not like in white-box testing). Functional testing usually describes what the system does.

> 功能性测试 - 功能性测试是一种质量保证的过程和黑盒测试。其测试用例基于被测试软件组件的规范。功能通过提供输入和校验输出来进行测试，很少考虑其内部程序架构（与白盒测试不同）。功能性测试经常用来表示系统是做何用的？

<!-- Integration Testing - Integration testing (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing.

> 集成测试 - 集成测试（有时也叫做集成与测试，缩写I&T）是软件测试中的阶段，在这个阶段，单个软件模块被组合一起并以一组进行测试。这阶段出现于单元测试之后，校验测试之前。集成测试将已经单元测试的输入模块作为输入模块，将它们分组为更大的聚合，将集成测试计划中定义的测试应用于这些聚合，并将集成系统作为输出交付给系统测试。
