Generally speaking, front-end technologies can run on the aforementioned operating systems and devices using the following run time web platform scenarios:

A web browser (examples: Chrome, IE, Safari, Firefox).
A headless browser (examples: Headless Chromium).
A WebView/browser tab (think iframe) embedded within a native application as a runtime with a bridge to native APIs. WebView applications typically contain a UI constructed from web technologies. (i.e., HTML, CSS, and JS). (examples: Apache Cordova, NW.js, Electron)
A native application built from web tech that is interpreted at runtime with a bridge to native APIs. The UI will make use of native UI parts (e.g., iOS native controls) not web technologies. (examples: NativeScript, React Native)
